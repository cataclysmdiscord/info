                    <h1>Rules</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                    <p>1. <strong>Respect everyone.</strong> Hate speech or slander against any particular race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual identity, etc. is unacceptable.</p>
                    
                    <p>2. <strong>No bullying.</strong> Harassment is not tolerated. This doesn’t that everywhere in the server is a “safe-space,” but if you’re attacking someone for no good reason then you’re out of line.</p>
                    
                    <p>3. <strong>No porn/nudity.</strong> NSFW, 18+, and sensitive content are explicitly forbidden. It is punishable by ban on the first offense.</p>
                    
                    <p>4. <strong>No excessive swearing.</strong> This does not mean that cuss words are forbidden, but use within reason. When in doubt, censor yourself.</p>
                    
                    <p>5. <strong>No spam.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to, the following: sending 10+ consecutive messages in a row, sending the same link several times, sending the same image more than once, posting a topic in the incorrect chat room, etc.</p>
                    
                    <p>6. <strong>No excessive role requests.</strong> I assure you, the more you ask, the less likely you are to obtain the requested role and the more likely you are to receive a downgrade or kick.</p>
                    
                    <p>7. <strong>Speak in the appropriate channels.</strong> For example, do not post Overwatch pics in the <channel>#server-requests</channel> room.</p>
                    
                    <p>8. <strong>Do not argue with the staff.</strong> What we say goes. If we give you a warning, don&rsquo;t sass the staff member who gave it.</p>
                    
                    <p>9. <strong>Do not abuse your nickname privilege.</strong> If you want a nickname, it must be alphanumeric, or at the bare minimum the first 3 characters should be.</p>
                    
                    <p>10. <strong>Do not start drama.</strong> If you&rsquo;re intentionally causing server-wide pandemonium, you&rsquo;ll be ejected immediately.</p>
                    
                    <p>11. <strong>Do not exploit game chat rooms.</strong> If you are playing a game, such as Town of Salem, and you are cheating via means of discussing outside the game, that is a punishable offense.</p>
                
                    <p>12. <strong>Be careful with your word choice.</strong> Do not say anything that may be misconstrued as malicious or inappropriate. For example, do not, as an adult, speak to a minor as if they are your significant other.<span style="color: #787878;">*</span></p>
                    <p><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*Additionally, do not expect a promotion to a staff member if your speech signifies immaturity of some kind. This is not a rule, but a good thing to note if you wish to be promoted.</span></em></p>
                    
                    <p>Note: Links to other servers are <em>automatically deleted</em> as a precaution against excessive advertising. If you would like to send a link to another server, let <owner>@System</owner> know.</p>
