# The Cataclysm
If you've found this, then I suppose you know how to use GitHub! Congratulations.

We're pretty happy to have you here on the server.
## Site Info
* The website uses a Bootstrap template
   * [Here's](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) a link to it. It's super simple, but it's a great starting point if you know what you're doing. Startbootstrap includes a ton of more complex templates if you don't know what you're doing as well.
* The site was coded by [Hope](https://github.com/hopesimon), one of the admins of the server.
   * You might notice some of this GitHub was uploaded or edited with her account.
## Server Info
If you accidentally stumbled upon this GitHub, come check out our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KwaB4eU).

We're a pretty relaxed Discord, although we need to keep in mind there are a couple of younger kids in the server.
